# CLAUDE.md

RAG app with chat (default) and document ingestion interfaces. Config via env vars, no admin UI.

## Stack
- Frontend: React + Vite + Tailwind + shadcn/ui
- Backend: Python + FastAPI
- Database: Supabase (Postgres, pgvector, Auth, Storage, Realtime)
- LLM: OpenAI (Module 1), OpenRouter (Module 2+)
- Observability: LangSmith

## Rules
- No LangChain, no LangGraph - raw SDK calls only
- Use Pydantic for structured LLM outputs
- All tables need Row-Level Security - users only see their own data
- Stream chat responses via SSE
- Use Supabase Realtime for ingestion status updates
- Module 2+ uses stateless completions - store and send chat history yourself
- Ingestion is manual file upload only - no connectors or automated pipelines

## Planning
- Save all plans to `.agent/plans/` folder
- Naming convention: `{sequence}.{plan-name}.md` (e.g., `1.auth-setup.md`, `2.document-ingestion.md`)
- Plans should be detailed enough to execute without ambiguity
- Each task in the plan must include at least one validation test to verify it works
- Assess complexity and single-pass feasibility - can an agent realistically complete this in one go?
- Include a complexity indicator at the top of each plan:
  - ✅ **Simple** - Single-pass executable, low risk
  - ⚠️ **Medium** - May need iteration, some complexity
  - 🔴 **Complex** - Break into sub-plans before executing

## Development Flow
1. **Plan** - Create a detailed plan and save it to `.agent/plans/`
2. **Build** - Execute the plan to implement the feature
3. **Validate** - Test and verify the implementation works correctly. Use browser testing where applicable via an appropriate MCP
4. **Iterate** - Fix any issues found during validation
